                    <h2>J-la's Epalog</h2>
                    <p>J-La's Epalog is a new popular go-to food store in Taytay, Rizal. With over 30 years in the industry, J-La's epalog claims to be the "home of the original epalog." 
                        Epalog comes from the words "hepa log," hepa, and itlog. According to the owner, it is named that way because of how similar the color of the egg is to those people who have hepa, or hepatitis, 
                        but they later changed the name to epalog to stop the negative connotation.
