This Project We, the Lakbayin Inc., are a technology enthusiast and non-profit body that aims to showcase and patronize the beauty of the Philippines through an interactive website.

As students from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Main Campus, we - Jillian Leonin, Franchesca Noblejas, Xypher Kelly Bumatay, John Paul Edit,
Christian Francis Sanchez, and Marckus Rey Santiago - originally founded the Lakbayin Inc. in the year 2023 in partial fulfillment of our project in the course subject titled Computer Engineering Technology 5 under the supervision of Ms. Abby Kate C. Orioque.

The company name is derived from the Filipino word "Lakbayin" which means "to travel around something or to journey somewhere." As fellow Filipinos, we believe that taking inspiration from it will allow us to inspire also the viewers to appreciate some of the country's places, most especially those that are not much familiar to the public.
